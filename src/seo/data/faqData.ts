    question: 'What are Sharing Circles?',
    answer: 'Sharing Circles are small, topic-based group chats where you can discuss specific feelings or situations with people who relate. They are warm, moderated, and supportive.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it really anonymous?',
    answer: 'Yes. You choose a pseudonym (like "CoffeeLover99") and an avatar. We don\'t require your real name or photo to start chatting, so you can share without fear of judgment.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are the listeners therapists?',
    answer: 'No, they are regular people like you who want to offer support. They are "peers" who practice active listening. CoffieCalm is for support, not clinical therapy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it cost anything?',
    answer: 'CoffieCalm is free to join. You can participate in Sharing Circles and basic Quiet Corner chats at no cost. We may offer premium features in the future, but support should be accessible to everyone.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I leave a conversation anytime?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We respect your boundaries. If a conversation doesn\'t feel right or you just need to go, you can leave without any pressure or explanation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I need help in a crisis?',
    answer: 'If you\'re experiencing a mental health emergency, please call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or go to your nearest emergency room. CoffieCalm is a peer support platform, not a crisis service.'
